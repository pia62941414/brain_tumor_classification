# brain_tumor_classification

The most prevalent and dangerous disease, brain tumours have a very low life expectancy in their highest grade. Thus, a crucial step in enhancing patients' quality of life is treatment planning. Generally speaking, tumours in the brain, lung, liver, breast, prostate, etc. are evaluated using a variety of imaging modalities, including computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound images.
I tried to implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Image Processing to find whether the patient is having brain tumor or not. One layer each of convolution, max-pooling, and flattening, followed by a full connection from one hidden layer, was the most basic CNN architecture we could create.
